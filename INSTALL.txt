BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR TEAM 12 PROJECT
    Find below detailed instructions on how to successfully download, extract and build our project files.
    
Libraries / Software Used:
    1. Google Protocol Buffers version 2.6.1
    2. Google Test Framework version 1.7.0
    3. Doxygen version 1.8
Both Google libraries are required for building the project and have been included within the repository to make this easier. A Doxygen configuration file has been included for compiling the documentation.

Build Instructions:
    1. Install Visual Studio 2013.
    2. Clone or download the entire repository from the GitHub page.
        a. This may be done directly through Visual Studio by following the instructions of this page: http://www.malgreve.net/2014/06/17/cloning-getting-code-from-git-repository-to-visual-studio/
    4. Open the Team12.sln in Visual Studio 2013 
    5. Build the solution in either the Debug or Release configuration (32-bit ONLY).
    6. (Optional) To rebuild the documentation, download Doxygen and run it with the Doxyfile included.

Running the Project
    1. Complete a Debug or Release build as described above.
    2. If you wish to run the code from within Visual Studio, you can:
        a. Right click on the project in the solution explorer that you wish to run (Team12Main or Team12Test) and select "Set as StartUp Project"
        b. Choose Debug -> Start Without Debugging from the top menu.
    3. You may also run the program manually by going to <CheckoutDirectory>\Team12\<Debug_or_Release>\ and running SEng330A2Main.exe or SEng330A2Test.exe.

NOTES:
    - Google Protocol Buffers has been integrated into the IDE via a custom build step,
  simply change the .proto file in the IDE and build the solution as normal to generate
  new files.
    - The Team12 project creates a static library used in the other two projects.
    - The Team12Main project is a runner for the Team12 static library.
    - The Team12Test project is a project containing tests for the Team12 static library.
